                            Prerequisites

The Artworkgallery web application has been developed and tested with
- PHP 7.1.9
- MySQL 5.7.19
- Apache httpd 2.4.27
- Mozilla Firefox 57.0.3 (64 Bit)
- Internet Explorer 11.0.9600.18837
- Windows 7 Enterprise Edition 64 bit (all aforemnetioned applications running on one box)

The application should work on any LAMP stack with PHP 7. 


                            Unpacking the files

Create a new directory on your web server (we call this the ROOT_DIR in the following). Unpack under 
ROOT_DIR the files and sub-directories of the application. Ensure that the UTF-8 encoding of the files is 
preserved. 


                            Preparing the database

You need to get access to an empty MySQL database schema with the permission to create new database tables. 
Connect with a MySQL client (e.g. MySQL Workbench or MySQL command line) to the empty database and execute
the scripts (*.sql) located under ROOT_DIR/installation/database_scripts. It does not matter in which sequence 
you apply the database scripts.


                            Configurimg the database connection
                            
Open with a text editor the file ROOT_DIR/db/database.php and replace after line 52 the entries for 
dbHost (IP address or host name of your database server), dbName (name of your database schema), 
dbUser (user to connect to the database), dbPassword (password for your database), dbPort (port of your database) 
with the data for your database

        $this->dbHost = '127.0.0.1';
        $this->dbName = 'kiekmolwedderin';
        $this->dbUser = 'hanns';
        $this->dbPassword = 'hanns';
        $this->dbPort = 3306;

In a hosting environment you will get the aforementioned data from your hosting provider. 
Be sure to keep the single quotes ' ' for the first four entries and save the file with UTF-8 encoding. 


                            Configuring the access data for the Administration pages
                                                 
Open with a text editor the file ROOT_DIR/controller/login_controller.php and replace in lines 59 - 60 the entries for 
$adminMail (that must be a valid e-mail address) and $adminPassword with the values ypu want to use

        $adminMail = "your-namen@your-domain.your-domain-extension";
        $adminPassword = "your-password";

Ensure that the UTF-8 encoding of the file is preserved.


                            Preparing the web server
                            
Register ROOT_DIR with your web server as the default directory for the application and the file 
ROOT_DIR/index.php as the default file. Start the web server so that you can access the application with 
a Web browser. 


                            Accessing the Administration pages
                            
Type in the address line of your browser the Web URL of your deployment of the Artworkgallery application and 
append the name admin.php (e.g. http://your-domain.com/artworkgallery/admin.php). That will open the login 
page where you enter the credentials for accessing the Administration pages (the e-mail and password you 
created in a previous step). These credentials will be cached for the duration of the session and you will 
get links in the pages to directlly navigate to the Administration area.
